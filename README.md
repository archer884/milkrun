...An orbital resonance calculator? I dunno what to call this.

## "Link us to a project you're proud of."

Yeah, I can hear you already: why the hell did you choose this? Good question.

I wrote this when I was last playing [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/). What it *does* is very simple: it calculates the resonant orbit required to transfer a payload of several satellites into an orbit resembling, say, an equilateral triangle--or a box, or a pentagon, or--with one satellite at each corner. Basically because it [looks cool](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpJgAO0buh8/maxresdefault.jpg). The program does that, but of course it's two years old, and I haven't really touched it since then, so it's not exactly hypermodern Rust or anything. So, to answer your question....

Most of the code I write is in a known domain. I get how the internet works, and I understand the basics of file systems and hashing, and I'm ok at pretending to be a web browser so I can fool Reddit into thinking I'm just clicking *really fast.* No big deal. This stuff? It's literal rocket ~~surgery~~ science. I don't know the first thing about orbital mechanics. In short, I chose this program because it demonstrates that I can write software **while learning about an unfamiliar domain.**

At least, I hope it does.
